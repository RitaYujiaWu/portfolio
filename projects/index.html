            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explored reasoning frameworks such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and the LLM Reasoners
                    library to solve Zebra Logic Puzzles.</li>
                <li>Developed naive and advanced methods, reporting accuracy metrics, identifying limitations, and providing
                    comprehensive analysis of failure cases.</li>
                <li>Visualized ToT-based solutions, highlighting cases where advanced methods outperformed naive approaches.</li>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborated on analyzing kid-friendly recipes, focusing on factors such as sodium levels, balanced nutrients, and
                    preparation processes using statistical (hypothesis testing) and machine learning tools (Decision Trees).</li>
                <li>Processed and cleaned recipe data from online sources, employing Python and visualization tools to represent nutritional
                    distributions and their alignment with health standards.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>This individual project is based on High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector and focuses on building two prediction models: 
                    to estimate the energy through regression and to provide a "classification score" for detector noise.</li>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>This collaborative DataHacks project focuses on visualizing the dinosaur data from the Triassic to the Cretaceous, 
                    analyzing and rationalizing the trend of dinosaur types and characteristics from temporal and geographical aspects. 
                    This project won the best presentation awards at the DataHacks.</li>
