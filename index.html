    <p>
        I'm a Data Science and Applied Mathematics double major with a strong foundation in algebras, (machine learning) algorithms, and data structures. 
        As a junior at UC San Diego, I am passionate about using machine learning techniques to solve complex problems and develop innovative solutions. 
        My current work includes projects that explore the intersection of data science and finance, including Text2SQL models and NLP-based solutions.üòé‚úåÔ∏è
        I am always eager to expand my knowledge and apply it to real-world applications, collaborating with others to drive impactful change. 
        I enjoy tackling challenging tasks that push my skills to new heights, and I look forward to continuing my journey in the tech world by learning, 
        innovating, and sharing knowledge with like-minded individuals! Connect with me! ü§©
